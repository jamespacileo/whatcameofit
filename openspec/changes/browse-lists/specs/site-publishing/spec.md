## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Long lists are read a page at a time
The home page SHALL list every source article of published claims, newest first, and every published claim with a status, most recently set first, showing ten rows of each at a time. Every other list of claims SHALL show 25 rows at a time. A list longer than one page SHALL have, directly under it, a control to step to the next and the previous page and a line saying which rows are shown and how many there are. A list that fits one page SHALL show no such control. Where a list can be narrowed by status, the narrowing SHALL apply to the whole list and SHALL return the reader to its first page.

Every row SHALL be in the page as built: with scripting off, and in print, the whole list SHALL be shown. The page in view SHALL be recorded in the page's address, and an address naming a page that does not exist SHALL show the nearest page that does.

#### Scenario: More rows than one page
- **WHEN** published claims have 104 source articles between them
- **THEN** the home page shows the ten newest, says "1–10 of 104 headlines", and the next step shows the eleventh to the twentieth

#### Scenario: A list that fits one page
- **WHEN** a topic has four published claims
- **THEN** all four are shown and no paging control is shown

#### Scenario: A page that does not exist
- **WHEN** the address names page 99 of a list with eleven pages
- **THEN** the eleventh page is shown

#### Scenario: Narrowing by status
- **WHEN** a reader on the second page of a year's claims picks a status
- **THEN** the claims at that status across the whole year are listed from their first page

#### Scenario: Scripting off
- **WHEN** the home page is opened with scripting off
- **THEN** every headline and every claim is listed
