## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Bounded visual reading
The service SHALL accept one inline PNG/JPEG at most 750KB, 1600px maximum side and 1MP. It SHALL validate dimensions and request size before paid calls. It SHALL treat all pixels and text as untrusted report content, never instructions or proof. Identification failure SHALL be worded as insufficient identification, not absence of a treatment claim.

#### Scenario: Image-only claim
- **WHEN** a valid screenshot accompanies a short caption
- **THEN** both reach one model reading call and candidate scoring remains unchanged

### Requirement: Shared on-demand results
The service MAY retain structured automatic findings from independently public reports for 24h and reuse them across clients by a hashed cleaned URL. It SHALL retain no copied report text, screenshots or reader identity. Shared answers SHALL remain unreviewed and dated. Browser-only or selected content SHALL NOT populate shared storage.

#### Scenario: Previously processed public report
- **WHEN** a fresh shared result exists for the requested source
- **THEN** the service returns it with its original checked-at time and no model call

#### Scenario: Public access cannot be verified
- **WHEN** the service cannot independently read a report publicly
- **THEN** visual lookup may proceed but its result remains in the reader's local cache only
